= Journey {<img src="https://secure.travis-ci.org/rails/journey.png"/>}[http://travis-ci.org/rails/journey]

* http://github.com/rails/journey

== DESCRIPTION:

Journey is a router.  It routes requests.

The problem of finding a route that matches a request, is a bit similar to walking an Abstract Syntax Tree, and this is where Journey comes in.

Look at this grammar:

  ROUTE = GET | POST | PUT |Â DELETE  path
  path = (static_path | dynamic_path).format

What we have here is similar to a mini-programming language, with a mandatory request verb and advanced matching logic.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Designed for rails

== SYNOPSIS:

Journey approaches Routes definitions with a Parse tree with the goal to make path lookup faster.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* None

== INSTALL:

* gem install journey
